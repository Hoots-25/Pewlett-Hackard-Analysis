# Employee Database with SQL

## Project Overview 
The goal of this project was to assist Bobby in creating SQL databases that identify retiring employees as a function of job title, and to determine employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
* It was found that 90398 employees are eligible for retirment. 
* The breakdown of employees by job title can be [found here](Resources/retiring_eligibility.png).
* [Here](Resources/unique_titles.png) is the list of employees and their most current job titles
* A query to create a Mentorship Eligibility table that holds the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program was mad and can be seen [here](Resources/mentorship_eligibility.png).

## Summary

90398 employees are up for retirement eligibility. These people will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to impact. Based on the mentorship eligibility database, only 1549 employees are able to mentor the next generation of employees at Pewlett Hackard. There is a lot of training and knowledge retention to be completed prior to the start and impact of the potential "silver tsunami".
